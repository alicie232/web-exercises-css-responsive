## Tasks for this exercise

### Task 1 - Dark vs. Light!

This Exercise is built with dark-mode as the default theme, because light attracts all these bugs :) however.. some people prefer a light-mode, so lets build a light mode for all these bug-lovers!

- Remember: Set your media-queries close to the concerning parts of your css
- Dont spend to much time on finding the right colors, try to make the point and move on :)

### Task 2 - Mobile vs. Tablet vs. Desktop

We all know there are a couple of screensizes out there! This Exercise is of course built "mobile first" so go and develop the Tablet (minimum width 600px) and Desktop (minimum width 1000px) views! Note: These are not neccessarily appropriate Breakpoints, they are for practice!

- We want the articles to be in two columns on Tablets, let every articles width be 40% of the viewport-width
- On Desktop view we want four columns, but only a width of 20% of the viewport-width for each article
- Find a way to keep the main section filling the space between header and footer at all screen sizes ( no, dont just add more articles :) )
- On Tablet and Desktop the icon in the upper-right corner of each article should be in the lower-right corner - itÂ´s not neccessarily prettier, but shows we are abled to do it
- apply a responsive font-size and add variations for each device-type

### Task 3 - You can flip your phone! ( SUPER EXTRA TASK :) )

You could catch this orientation change with the viewport-width, but there is also a way to go directly for a flipped phone! Lets bring something into the bottom-right corner of the viewport, that only appears if the media orientation is landscape!

- I think a heart could be appropriate..
- Can you find a way without including any kind of image/icon?
- Dont try toooo hard, this is kind of a wild whacky task, just ultimately go for it, if you enjoy doing it :) else.. try using an image or svg, or leave this task as it is
- okay, one last hint: you could use :before and :after
